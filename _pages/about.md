I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Mathematical Sciences Research Institute] (https://www.msri.org) at Berkeley, CA. Prior to this, I have held postdoctoral positions in the Department of Mathematics at Stony Brook University and in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

My primary areas of interest are computational fluid dynamics and quantum computing.
