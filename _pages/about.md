I am currently a [postdoctoral researcher](https://www.msri.org/people/45428) at Mathematical Sciences Research Institute at Berkeley, CA. Prior to this, I have held postdoctoral positions in the Department of Mathematics at Stony Brook University and in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My two primary areas of interest are computational fluid dynamics and quantum computing.
